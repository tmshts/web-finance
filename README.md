# cs50
This is the solution for problem set from the course CS50 presented by Harvard Univesity.

The main goal was to create a website where an user can buy and sell the stocks. Furthemore, the user can see the entire history of transactions.

It was necessary to create a registration page and the login page for the users as well. Multiple users are able to create their account and then log in thanks to the Flask-Session.

All the pages are stylized in the layout.html.

I use the Python, HTML, CSS, Flask, Jinja and some help functions provided by CS50 course.
